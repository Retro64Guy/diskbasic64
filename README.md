# diskbasic64
A C64 Basic Extension inspired by OldSkoolCoder (John) but more Disk related Commands
and utility functions.

This is my first attempt to publish onw of my projects on git.
It's not my first C64 assembler project at all, but the first thing I published on git.

I'm a complete noob in using GIT. So I've already produced some commit and push errors on git.
But it works and by the time I will also learn how to use git.

I'll try to finish this project bug free and by the time I will publish more of my projects
to contribute with other C64 developers.
